We welcome patches!

## Commit hygiene

We like to follow the recommendations set out in the GDS [git style guide][gitstyle]
which describes how we prefer git history and commit messages to read.

## Visual changes

For visual changes, it can be helpful to provide images in your pull-request
showing before and after to highlight the differences.
